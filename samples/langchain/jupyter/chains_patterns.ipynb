      "\n",
      "1. **Subject**: \n",
      "   - **\"The quick brown fox\"**\n",
      "     - **\"The\"**: Definite article specifying a particular noun.\n",
      "     - **\"quick\"**: Adjective describing the speed of the fox.\n",
      "     - **\"brown\"**: Adjective describing the color of the fox.\n",
      "     - **\"fox\"**: Noun, the main subject of the sentence.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Verb**:\n",
      "   - **\"jumps\"**: Action verb indicating the movement of the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Prepositional Phrase**:\n",
      "   - **\"over the lazy dog\"**\n",
      "     - **\"over\"**: Preposition indicating the relationship between the action and the object.\n",
      "     - **\"the\"**: Definite article specifying a particular noun.\n",
      "     - **\"lazy\"**: Adjective describing the state of the dog.\n",
      "     - **\"dog\"**: Noun, the object over which the fox jumps.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Elaborated Analysis: \"Fox jumps.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Subject Identification**:\n",
      "   - The primary subject of the sentence is \"the quick brown fox.\" When we simplify this to \"fox,\" we retain the core noun performing the action.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Action Identification**:\n",
      "   - The verb \"jumps\" indicates the action being performed by the subject. This verb is crucial as it conveys the dynamic movement of the fox.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Object of the Preposition**:\n",
      "   - Though the phrase \"over the lazy dog\" provides additional context about the action, the core idea of the sentence can be distilled to the fox performing the jump. \n",
      "\n",
      "### Contextual Significance\n",
      "\n",
      "- **\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\"** is a pangram—a sentence that uses every letter of the alphabet at least once. It’s often used to test typewriters, keyboards, and fonts.\n",
      "- The phrase \"fox jumps\" captures the essential action and subject, stripping away the descriptive adjectives and the prepositional phrase for a more straightforward interpretation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Core Meaning**: The fundamental action in the sentence is a fox jumping.\n",
      "- **Simplified Version**: \"Fox jumps\" retains the subject and the verb, offering a clear and concise representation of the action taking place.\n",
      "\n",
      "This analysis helps in understanding the essential components of the sentence while also appreciating the additional descriptive elements that enrich the original pangram.\n"

      "Result: LangChain is a framework designed to simplify the creation of applications that use large language models (LLMs). It provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications. Here’s a breakdown of its key features and components:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Features:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Standard Interface**:\n",
      "   - LangChain offers a consistent API for interacting with different LLMs, making it easier to switch between models or use multiple models in a single application.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Chains**:\n",
      "   - Chains are sequences of steps where the output of one step is the input to the next. LangChain allows you to create complex workflows by chaining together various components like prompts, LLMs, and tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Agents**:\n",
      "   - Agents are more dynamic versions of chains that can make decisions about which tools to use based on the input. They are useful for tasks that require more flexibility and decision-making.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Memory**:\n",
      "   - LangChain provides mechanisms to add memory to chains and agents, allowing them to retain context over multiple interactions. This is useful for maintaining state in conversations or multi-step tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Integrations**:\n",
      "   - The framework includes integrations with various tools and services, such as APIs, databases, and other software, enabling more complex and useful applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Templates and Prompts**:\n",
      "   - LangChain offers utilities for managing prompts, including templates that can be filled in with dynamic data. This helps in creating more contextually aware inputs for LLMs.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Evaluation and Testing**:\n",
      "   - Tools for evaluating the performance of chains and agents, helping to iterate and improve your applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Common Use Cases:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Chatbots**: Creating conversational agents that can handle complex queries and maintain context.\n",
      "- ** summarization**: Building applications that can summarize long documents or conversations.\n",
      "- **Question Answering**: Developing systems that can answer questions based on provided documents or knowledge bases.\n",
      "- **Automation**: Creating automated workflows that leverage LLMs for tasks like data extraction, report generation, and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Example Workflow:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Define a Prompt**: Create a template for the input to the LLM.\n",
      "2. **Select an LLM**: Choose which language model to use.\n",
      "3. **Chain Components**: Add additional steps like data retrieval, transformation, or additional model calls.\n",
      "4. **Execute the Chain**: Run the chain to get the output.\n",
      "5. **Optional: Add Memory**: Store context to maintain state across interactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Example Code Snippet:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "from langchain import PromptTemplate, LLMChain\n",
      "from langchain.llms import OpenAI\n",

    "| Pattern | Syntax | Use Case |\n",
    "|---------|--------|----------|\n",
    "| Simple Chain | `prompt \\| llm \\| parser` | Basic transformations |\n",
    "| Sequential | Multiple chains in order | Multi-step processing |\n",
    "| Parallel | `RunnableParallel(...)` | Independent concurrent operations |\n",
    "| Branching | `RunnablePassthrough()` | Complex data flows |\n",
    "| Fallbacks | `.with_fallbacks([...])` | Error handling, redundancy |\n",

    "- **Readable**: Pipeline syntax makes logic clear\n",
    "- **Flexible**: Easy to add/remove/modify steps\n",
    "- **Async-ready**: All chains support async execution\n",
